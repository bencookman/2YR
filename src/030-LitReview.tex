% \section{Markstein Flame Modelling}

% Finding the Markstein number is crucial to predicting the behaviour of flames.

% LITERATURE:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \cite{clavin1982EffectsMolecularDiffusion} the first theoretical prediction of Markstein number from asymptotic theory
% \item \cite{matalon1982FlamesGasdynamicDiscontinuities} also predicted the same Markstein number in the same year from similar asymptotics
% \item \cite{searby1991ParametricAcousticInstability} proposes Mathieu model for secondary thermoacoustic instability. This is used to predict Markstein numbers experimentally by comparing sound frequency at the onset of parametric instability to the acoustic amplitude and comparing this data to theoretical predictions at different Markstein numbers. The disturbance wavenumber is also proposed as a method to find this Markstein number in a similar way.
% \item \cite{delfin2024DeterminationMethodMarkstein} measures Markstein numbers using the proposed method from \cite{searby1991ParametricAcousticInstability} by measuring disturbance wavenumbers at the onset of secondary instability and comparing them to theoretical values.
% \item \cite{day2009TurbulenceEffectsCellular} calculates Markstein numbers from simulation data for lean premixed H2-air combustion by computing JPDFs of flame speed against flame curvature. Each data point in these JPDFs is an \emph{integral tubes} (the area bounded by 3 or more integral curves, in 3D) of $\vec{\nabla} c$ for $c$ the reactant progress variable with values taken at $c=0.98$, representing the position of the flame.
% \item \cite{howarth2022EmpiricalCharacteristicScaling} and \cite{howarth2023ThermodiffusivelyunstableLeanPremixed} follow the same method as \cite{day2009TurbulenceEffectsCellular}, but incorporates the strain term to the right-hand side calculation, uses $c=0.9$. Care is taken to ensure that the chosen flame surface is representative of the flame. They also evaluate individual Markstein numbers for the curvature and strain term on the RHS, as suggested in \cite{clavin2011CurvedStretchedFlames} (TALK ABOUT THIS PAPER ABOVE??).
% \item \cite{davis2002MarksteinNumbersCounterflow} compares markstein numbers calculated from unburnt and burnt velocity values. (NEED TO READ??)

\end{figure}

Later on, work by Assier and Wu \cite{assier2014LinearWeaklyNonlinear} studied the stability of a \emph{flame-flow-acoustic} system, where a freely propagating flame in a duct which is periodic to the top and bottom and has one closed and open end to the left and right is considered. \fig{fig:assier-2014} illustrates this geometry, which is reminiscent of the experimental domain shown in \fig{fig:searby-experiment} of \cite{searby1992AcousticInstabilityPremixed}. Results from the hydrodynamic flame theory \cite{matalon1982FlamesGasdynamicDiscontinuities} are used to separate the dynamics within the flame from the outer fluid. This outer region is then separated into the usual $\cl{O}(1)$ hydrodynamic zone and a far-away $\cl{O}(1/\Ma)$ acoustic zone. Further asymptotic analysis is performed in the flame reference frame, which couples these two regions primarily through a time-dependent term in the jump conditions. The same weak non-linearity assumption is made as the MS equation to simplify their form of the flame equation and linear stability analysis is performed about the steady solutions to the MS equation.

They find that, when the acoustic interaction is included these solutions are no longer linearly stable and the maximum growth rate of this instability increases significantly with heat release $q$. They also perform non-linear stability analysis using a solver for the flame position coupled to the dynamical acoustic jump conditions. This is compared to the results of \cite{searby1992AcousticInstabilityPremixed} and they find they are able to qualitatively reproduce the primary instability and the onset of the secondary instability. In the latter case, the unsteady nature of the acoustic coupling to the flame induces an unsteady RT effect as the acoustic acceleration oscillates into and away from the less dense products. This can be viewed as the driving mechanism behind this parametric instability. In a later conference paper \cite{assier2014CombustionInstabilityModel}, they also find that by reintroducing the tangential velocity terms, the values of $\g$ which result in the same behaviour as seen in \cite{searby1992AcousticInstabilityPremixed} more closely match the values of $\g$ we expect. The results of both papers are surprisingly fruitful given their assumption of weak non-linearity despite the large heat releases that their model is tested against.

% Jun and Lee 2023

In \cite{jun2023ParametricInstabilityPropagating} the secondary instability in hydrogen enriched methane-air flames is studied numerically in an open-ended tube. The structure of their flames under the full non-linear effect of the secondary instability is an impressive match to the experiment of \cite{ebieto2017DynamicsPremixedFlames}, but this is in spite of a lack of convergence in the phase of sub-harmonic oscillations to the flame front between grid spacings of 100 μm to 50 μm. This may mean that the flame has been poorly resolved numerically. They also find that the Rayleigh Index, $\rm{RI}$ is a good indicator for the onset of the secondary instability and that the violent acoustic output of this parametric instability may also be attributed to the changes in flame surface area strengthening oscillations in heat release which cause the thermoacoustic effect.

\label{fig:porous-plug}
\end{figure}

Simpler analysis is performed by Gatón-Pérez et al. \cite{gaton-perez2025MitigationThermoacousticInstabilities} to evaluate the eigenstates of a one-dimensional closed-open tube containing a porous plug and a flame. Using Darcy's law to model the plug and assuming linear acoustics, the acoustic eigenmodes of the tube are found numerically. Experimental data is then compared against the one-dimensional model, where the heat release parameter, thermal length scale and the plug's permeability set by experimental values. The model is able to predict the flame locations within the tube which are most likely to trigger thermoacoustic resonance despite no consideration of the flame's motion or its thermal response to acoustics being made. These are the locations where the resulting acoustic eigenmodes have the lowest decay imposed by the porous plug. In this way, they show experimentally that the location of the porous plug may be chosen to preferentially mitigate different frequencies and reduce the likelihood of thermoacoustic instability. Evidently though, a simple one-dimensional model of this ilk is restricted in application to strongly one-dimensional, ducted combustors. As soon as a broader combustor or plenum is used, the two-dimensional acoustics (e.g. Helmholtz modes) must also be considered.

% The most blunt way to simulate a fluid system would be one where you try to accurately simulate every detail involved in the fluid.
% This idea was first studied by Orszag, where he defines direct numerical simulations as a numerical simulation with enough grid points to full resolve the smallest physical phenomena in the system
% Originally, Orszag studied this in the context of turbulent flows. In turbulent flows, we have vortices not only on the order of the typical flow length scale $L$, called the integral length scale, but also of sizes all the way down to the smallest turbulence scale known as the kolmogorov microscale, where the rate at which viscous dissipation effects dampen vortices far exceeds the inertial forces of the vortex.
% The size of this kolmogorov length scale is determined by the turbulent reynolds number and the integral scale with the relationship

% An alternative method that is widely used is LES and involves using models to estimate the transfer of energy at the smallest scale rather than fully simulating them [cite les review: Yang 2015]
% DNS for turbulent combustion are reviewed in \textbf{Domingo and Vervisch 2023} (with connection to LES) and \textbf{Chen 2011}.

% For small-scale, low-speed methan-air and hydrogen-air combustion, the flows we look at have similar properties to air, so are not very viscous meaning the smallest scale vortices in a fully developed turbulent may be ~...?
% But the turbulence usually isn't our biggest worry, since we also have the thin region that the reaction is taking place to resolve, usually only 300 {\textmu}m which is resolved with ~15 nodes in a high order code
% Regardless, when performing DNS careful consideration must be made to use ample sample points

\cite{thompson1987TimeDependentBoundary, thompson1990TimeDependentBoundaryConditions, poinsot1992BoundaryConditionsDirect, poinsot2005TheoreticalNumericalCombustion, sutherland2003ImprovedBoundaryConditions}

% [Thompson 1987, 1990, Poinsot and Lele 1992, Sutherland and Kennedy 2003, Poinsot and Veynante 2005]


% Many types of boundary conditions may be chosen for combustion schemes:
%% Periodic are very simple to enforce numerically so require no elaboration
%% No-slip or slip wall conditions
%% isothermal or adiabatic walls
%% acoustically reflecting or non-reflecting walls or inflow / outflow
%% In the case of inflow / outflow many more cases

% In most of these cases, we can use the formalism called characteristic boundary conditions (characteristic BCs)




% The simplest boundary conditions, i.e. those with constant (Dirichlet) boundary values (p=const), usually reflect acoustic waves back toward the interior of the domain. For most situations we want to simulate, this doesn't represent the physical situation, where we would rather pretend the medium continues outside of the compuational domain. This motivates a need for boundary conditions which do not reflect acoustic waves - non-reflecting boundary conditions. The formalisms are based of characteristic waves entering / leaving the domain

% Fixed velocity inlets give full reflections, so cannot be used in a non-reflecting case.

% Immersed boundary methods are also an option and open up possibilities for boundaries not restricted specific node placement, especially for moving boundaries. But as detailed in King 2022, these a largely restricted to lower order accuracy at these boundaries (cite, and for what reason?).



\subsection{Time Domain Impedance Boundary Conditions}


Models effect of boundary impedance??


\subsubsection{Delayed-Time Domain Impedance Boundary Conditions}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{example-image-a}
\caption{D-TDIBC}
\label{fig:D-TDIBC}
\end{figure}
        
Although many variations on TDIBC exist, the \emph{Delayed-Time Domain Impedance Boundary Conditions} (D-TDIBC) of \cite{douasbin2018DelayedtimeDomainImpedance} are particularly relevant for the simulation of thermoacoustic instabilities. By modelling the effect of an acoustic time delay, $t_{\rm{delay}}$, a part of the computational domain - say, an exhaust pipe - may be truncated in place of a numerical boundary. Then, the response of this new boundary to incoming acoustics should be a sinusoidal Moiré pattern in the frequency domain. The proposition of \cite{douasbin2018DelayedtimeDomainImpedance} is that this pattern may be modelled via a meromorphic function of $2n$ simple poles. The location of these poles and their residues are then found in a preprocessing step as the values which minimise the least-squares fit with the desired response curve. Each time step then, the resulting constants are used to evaluate the change in acoustic variable at the boundary in such a way that no memory of previous time steps are required. 

After validating the model by testing its response to a Gaussian pressure bump, the model is compared against DNS of methane-air combustion in a 2D flame holder, where the upstream end is closed and the downstream end is open. Comparing this to DNS where the last 25 cm at the downstream end has been truncated to use D-TDIBC, they find that the time delay model accurately recovers the one-, three- and five-quarter eigenmode shapes, with small quantitative errors in their sound spectra. Considering the $\sim 13\%$ reduction in degrees of freedom in the computational domain resulting from the truncation, this can be seen as an impressive recovery of the problem's physics by using what is essentially a one-dimensional low-order model in the truncated region for the acoustics. Since the model constants are calculated as a preprocessing step, the envelope of the acoustic response in the frequency domain may essentially be changed arbitrarily, presenting a benefit in case different pass bands are desired.

Besides the inevitable drawbacks coming from low-order model inaccuracy and the requirement of a strongly one-dimensional flow at the time delay boundary to match this model, other drawbacks remain prevalent. For one, no method to visualise acoustics residing in the fictitious, truncated domain is provided, potentially leading to a \emph{black-box} of energy where acoustics are essentially stored, but not known. For another, the preprocessing steps are required for each value of $t_{\rm{delay}}$ used. So, if the time delay were to change dynamically during the simulation (e.g. due to an expanding computational domain to ensure the flame remains within), this preprocessing may happen each step, becoming computationally costly.
