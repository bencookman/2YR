\begin{itemize}
\item Broader context
    \begin{itemize}
    \item UK energy production and usage. Climate crisis, fuel switching and nuclear. Why is combustion so important even with nuclear? Hydrogen is another option. But [for reasons] is more susceptible to thermoacoustic instab. 
    \end{itemize}
\item Motivation for the PhD
    \begin{itemize}
    \item combustion instabilities
    \item porous media/complex geometries
    \item connections to other instabilities
    \end{itemize}
\item Motivation for this year's work
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Markstein??
    \item Expensive TA simulations usually
    \end{itemize}
\item In last year's report
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Explored the hydrodynamic model for flames and models derived therein, particularly the Markstein model and Michelson-Sivashinsky model
    \end{itemize}
\item Report structure / 'in this report we...'
    \begin{itemize}
    \item perform a lit review. discuss the numerical methods and techniques used. introduce the idea for delay BCs and implement them into an existing software. provide results and discussion. plan upcoming years of the phd
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
